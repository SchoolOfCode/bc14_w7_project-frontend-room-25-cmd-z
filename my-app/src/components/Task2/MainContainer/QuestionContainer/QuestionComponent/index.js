            <h4 class="underline">Assignment operator üü∞</h4>
            <p>In JavaScript, we call the = symbol the "assignment operator." The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.

            For example, if we have a variable named "x" and we want to assign the value of 10 to it, we would use the following code:</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The = symbol is used to indicate that we are assigning a value to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator (in this case, the variable "x").</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>It's important to note that the assignment operator is not the same as the "equals" sign. The "equals" sign is used to test for equality, whereas the assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.</p>
