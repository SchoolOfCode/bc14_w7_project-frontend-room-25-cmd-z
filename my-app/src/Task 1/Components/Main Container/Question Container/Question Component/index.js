            <h4> Intro to Variables</h4>
            <p>JavaScript, a "var" is a keyword used to declare a variable, which is a container for storing data. When you declare a variable using the "var" keyword, you are essentially creating a named placeholder in memory that can hold a value.
            The basic syntax for declaring a variable using the "var" keyword is as follows:
            var variableName;</p>
            <h5>True/False Statement:</h5>
            <p> When naming variables in JavaScript, itâ€™s recommended to use reserved keywords as variable names. </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default QuestionComponent;
